Pythia Cookbooks provide example workflows on more advanced and domain-specific problems developed by the Pythia community. Cookbooks build on top of skills you learn in Pythia Foundations."

Cookbooks are created from Jupyter Notebooks that we strive to binderize so each Cookbook can be executed in the cloud with a single click from your browswer. See documentation [here](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/preamble/how-to-use.html#interacting-with-jupyter-notebooks-in-the-cloud-via-binder) for details. In some instances executing a Cookbook will require downloading the Notebook to your local laptop or desktop as described [here](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/preamble/how-to-use.html#interacting-with-jupyter-books-locally).

Interested in contributing a new Cookbook or contributing to an existing Cookbook? Great! Please see the [Project Pythia Contributor's Guide](https://projectpythia.org/contributing.html) and Cookbook-specific information [here](https://github.com/ProjectPythia/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
