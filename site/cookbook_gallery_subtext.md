Pythia Cookbooks provide example workflows on more advanced and domain-specific problems developed by the Pythia community. Cookbooks build on top of skills you learn in [Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html).

Cookbooks are created from Jupyter Notebooks that we strive to binderize so each Cookbook can be [executed in the cloud with a single click from your browser](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/preamble/how-to-use.html#interacting-with-jupyter-notebooks-in-the-cloud-via-binder), but in some instances executing a Cookbook will require [running the notebooks locally](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/preamble/how-to-use.html#interacting-with-jupyter-books-locally).

Interested in contributing a new Cookbook or contributing to an existing Cookbook? Great! Please see the [Project Pythia Cookbook Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/ProjectPythia/.github/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), and consider opening a discussion under the [Project Pythia category of the Pangeo Discourse](https://discourse.pangeo.io/c/education/project-pythia/60).
